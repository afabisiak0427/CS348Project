# CS348Project
Project for Spring 2022 CS 348

This project will mimic a simplier version of pcpartpicker, where a user can choose between different CPUs, GPUs, RAMs, Motherboards, Storages, and Power Supplies
to create a base design for a computer they want to build. This will be using MongoDB, and Java to create a front end and back end server type program.
