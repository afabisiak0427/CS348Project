# CS348Project
Project for Spring 2022 CS 348
\nBy the "Alex Squad", our team consisting of:
\nAlex Fabisiak
\nJiahao Li
\nAlexander Glass

In our project, we will create a database system that will consist of a bunch of different PC parts and their specs, the different brands, what type of part it is, and their average reviews. 
These parts can be modified as newer parts come out, and parts can also be added to the lists. They can be connected across different tables with the item number as a primary key and their brand names being the foreign key connecting different tables, and the data can be sorted for easier readability.

To run our project we run PurduePartPickerApplication.java located in the CS348Project\Server\src\main\java\com\example\purduepartpicker\ to set up the server.
And then we run MainFrame.java located in CS348Project\Client\ to start the UI and the program, where a user can then start creating a new personal computer or looking up previous personal computer designs.
